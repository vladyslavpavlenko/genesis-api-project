### Makefile
For Unix-like systems, use the following command to build the application binary:
```sh
make up_build
```
For Windows systems, use the following command:
```cmd
make -f Makefile.windows build_app
```
To start the Docker containers without forcing a build, run:
```sh
make up
```
To stop the Docker containers, run:
```sh
make down
```

### Docker Compose
Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose commands directly:

Start the containers without forcing a build:
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
Build the application and start the containers:
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```
Stop the containers:
```sh
docker-compose down
```

### Accessing the Application
The application will be accessible at [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8081/).
